                <li><b>Beat the eggs</b>: In a bowl beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until there are all mixed. You can add tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture</li>
                <li><b>Heat the pan</b>: Place on non-stick frying pan over medium and add butter or oil</li>
                <li><b>Cook the omelette</b>: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
                <li><b>Add fillings(optional)</b>: When the eggs begin to heat at the edges but are still slightly running in the middle, sprinkle your chosen filling over one half of the omellete.</li>
                
                <li><b>Fold and serve</b>: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
                
                <li><b>Enjoy</b>: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
